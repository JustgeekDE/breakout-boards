# Attiny 25/45/85
A minimal breakout board for AttinyX5 microcontrollers. The board is the size of a standard 8-pin DIP, but contains the reset pull-up and 100n decoupling capacitor.

On the top there is also a footprint, to use [Madworms Tiny AVR pogo pin programming adaptor](https://www.tindie.com/products/madworm/tiny-avr-isp-pogo-pin-programmig-adapter/).
