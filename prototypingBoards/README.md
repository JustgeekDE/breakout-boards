# Breadboard breakouts
Some generic prototyping boards, mimicking the common breadboard design, with additional space for USB and barrel jack sockets.

The small boards fit the [SoB 5x5](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Sick_of_Beige_standard_PCB_sizes_v1.0) footprint, while the large ones are twice as long.
